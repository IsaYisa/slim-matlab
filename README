SLIM is a machine learning method for scoring systems using integer programming. For more on SLIM, check out:

http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04269

This package works with MATLAB 2014b and the IBM ILOG CPLEX V12.6. It may work with earlier versions of MATLAB and/or CPLEX, but this has not been tested and will not be supported.

We are currently working on developing a version of SLIM for Python + CPLEX, and a completely open source version using R.

Installing IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio is a commericial mathematical programming solver that can be called from MATLAB and can be obtained for free via the IBM Academic Initiative.

To setup latest version of the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio on your computer, you should:

1. Join the IBM Academic Initiative (may take up to 2 days)
-> See: http://www-304.ibm.com/ibm/university/academic/pub/page/mem_join

2. Download the "IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.6.1":
-> See: https://www-304.ibm.com/ibm/university/academic/member/softwaredownload
-> Make sure you choose the right version for your operating system
-> Check 'Download via HTTP' if you do not wish to use the IBM Download Director

3. Install the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio. 
-> If you are unfamiliar with how to install .bin files on a Mac, see: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21444285 

4. Add the CPLEX for MATLAB API to the MATLAB path using 'addpath': 

-> See: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.6.1/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/MATLAB/topics/gs_install.html

Please do not e-mail us if you have problems setting up the CPLEX for MATLAB API on your computer. Instead, check the CPLEX user manual at:
